** Machine Learning at the Network Edge: A Survey [[https://doi.org/10.1145/3469029]]

   This survey was pre-published in May 2021 and covers how
   learning techniques (deep, machine, resource-constraint, SVM,
   trees) were adapted to edge computing. It first focuses on how the
   models were used in resource-constrained settings in the following
   categories:
   - Lighter and Faster architectures
   - Distributed Training
   - Model compression
   - Distributed inference
   The section I thought was the most interesting for us at this point
   is the application section. It is stated that the most commun
   usage of ML in the edges are diverse: Computer vision applications
   (from traffic planning to object, recognition and surveillance),
   Speech Recognition - or voice assistance,
   User Privacy: Process the sensitive data without sending them to
     the cloud,
   Fraud Detection,
   Creating new datasets (reducing labeling),
   Autonomous Vehicles (on the road, critical in latency),
   Smart Homes and Cities,
   Human safety,
   Augmented Cognition.
